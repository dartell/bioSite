        <img id="pic1" src="images_D/Derrike_Stick.jpg" alt="Derrike playing fighting games" />
        
        <p>Derrike breathes fighting games.  A fighting game consist of two digital opponents who do different “moves” and attacks to whittle down the opponents life bar. 
            </p>
         
        <p> Derrike grew up playing these games in the arcade.  As a kid, he would go to the mall and spend countless hours playing anyone.  Starting out, he lost a lot.  This drove him to be the best.
        </p>
        
        <p>When arcades became less popular, Derrike’s hunger for competition grew.  Not satisfied with dominating the mall locals, he turned to sanctioned events to meet his demand for displaying dexterous skill on the 'sticks'.
        </p>

        <p>This tenacity eventually led him to winning a major fighting game championship.  One of his biggest accomplishments.  When asked what led to this victory he responds:
        </p>

        <q>Training for everyday eventually brought me to many different major competitors across the country.  I trained once a day for five years straight to win the belt” </q>

        <p>
        Woodworking, a grand hobby for Derrike, puts him a position of power and control. Woodworking involves planning cuts to make a shape, using glue and screws to manage the process, sand for smoothing, routing edges for polish, and drilling holes

         <q>I enjoy it (woodworking) because I bring projects to life.  It is also a great way to spend time with my Dad” </q>
        
        <p>He has many projects under his belt, including a rebuilt ‘In The Groove HD’ cabinet!  Other projects he has completed are arcade sticks and cabinets, projector screen, a computer desk for him and his wife, and a belt case for his championship belt
